# PysparkMiniProject
Map reduce using spark transformations. Shows the simplicity of scripting, and the speed of processing, with spark compared to hadoop.

Processes the car incident history data to produce a "report" on the number of incidents per make-year of car.

To run the script download all three files, and run run.sh in the terminal.

Your output should look like:
'Nissan-2003', 3
'Mercedes-2015', 5
'Mercedes-2016', 2
'Toyota-2017', 1
